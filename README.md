# Web-Scraping-Using-Beautiful-Soup
Our next computer science project is Web Scraping Using Beautiful Soup. Web scraping, also known as Web crawling, scans a collection of web pages to extract raw data from the web. As computer science engineers, you can use Beautiful Soup for web scraping to collect data from web pages and store it in various formats for analysis and decision making. Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data from them. It works with your favorite parser to yield idiomatic ways of searching, navigating, and modifying the parse tree. 
Web scraping with Beautiful Soup is more commonly associated with Python than Java. Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. However, if you want to perform web scraping in Java, you might consider using libraries like JSoup, which is specifically designed for Java and is similar to Beautiful Soup.
